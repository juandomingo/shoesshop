This is how I solved it:

You can follow step by step here:

MongoDB Steps:

Download the latest 64-bit MSI version of windows. https://www.mongodb.org/downloads Run the installer (.msi file)

Add it to your path of environment variables. Should be from: C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.0\bin

Create a “\data\db” folder which is used by mongodb to store all data.

Go Into C Drive and create a folder called ‘data’

Go into this created folder and create a folder called ‘db’

You should have this folder:

C:\data\db

Note: This is the default directory location expected by mongoDB, don’t create anywhere else.

Finally, open command prompt and type:

        mongod

You should see it asking for permissions (allow it) and then listen to a port. After that is done, open another command prompt, leaving the previous one running the server.

Type in the new command prompt

        mongo

You should see it display the version and connect to a test database.

This proves successful install!=)
